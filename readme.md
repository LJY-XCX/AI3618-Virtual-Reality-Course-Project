# Virtual Reality-Based Simulation for Robot Navigation and Manipulation in Unity

This is the repository of our course project of AI3618 Virtual Reality.
In this project, we employed the XR Interaction Toolkit in Unity to bind the user’s joints to the robot’s joints, achieving an embodied agent effect.
We designed various tasks assigned by our LLM-powered NPCs such as navigation, picking and placing, cutting fruits, and folding clothes for users to complete.
